# Contributing to Chisel

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Chisel! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Development Philosophy

Chisel follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles:

1. **Write failing tests first** - Before implementing any feature, write tests that describe the expected behavior
2. **Implement minimal code to pass** - Write just enough code to make the tests pass
3. **Refactor and improve** - Clean up the code while keeping tests green
4. **Repeat** - Continue this cycle for all new features

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- Make
- Git

### Setting up the development environment

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chisel.git
   cd chisel
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   make deps
   ```
4. Run tests to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a feature branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Write tests first
Before implementing any functionality, write comprehensive tests:

```bash
# Create test file
touch pkg/your-package/your-feature_test.go

# Write failing tests that describe the expected behavior
# Run tests to confirm they fail
make test
```

### 3. Implement the feature
Write the minimal code needed to make your tests pass:

```bash
# Implement your feature
# Run tests frequently
make test
```

### 4. Refactor and improve
Once tests are passing, improve the code quality:

- Remove duplication
- Improve naming
- Add documentation
- Ensure error handling is robust

### 5. Run the full test suite
```bash
make test
make test-integration  # When available
make lint
```

## Code Standards

### Go Code Style
- Follow standard Go formatting (`gofmt`)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write clear, concise comments
- Handle errors appropriately
- Use interfaces for testability

### Testing Standards
- Write table-driven tests when appropriate
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both happy path and error cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for high test coverage

### Example Test Structure
```go
func TestFeature_Method(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        input    InputType
        expected ExpectedType
        wantErr  bool
    }{
        {
            name:     "valid input",
            input:    validInput,
            expected: expectedOutput,
            wantErr:  false,
        },
        {
            name:    "invalid input",
            input:   invalidInput,
            wantErr: true,
        },
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            result, err := Method(tt.input)
            if tt.wantErr {
                if err == nil {
                    t.Error("expected error but got none")
                }
                return
            }
            if err != nil {
                t.Errorf("unexpected error: %v", err)
            }
            if result != tt.expected {
                t.Errorf("got %v, want %v", result, tt.expected)
            }
        })
    }
}
```
