Thought for 1m 6s
Fettle — A Modern, Go-native Configuration Management System (chef/puppet Alternative)

Fettle — A modern, Go‑native configuration management system (Chef/Puppet alternative)
Tagline: Declarative, drift‑proof infrastructure. Fast, composable, and safe.

1) Name, Brand, and Logo
Product name
Fettle (verb: to put in good order/trim). Distinctive, short, evocative of “making and keeping systems tidy,” and easy to pronounce in most languages.

Brand pillars
Clarity (explicit state, no hidden magic)

Trust (provable idempotence, plans, policy gates, audit)

Velocity (fast agent, high‑throughput controller, incremental graphs)

Composability (WASM providers, module registry, typed interfaces)

Visual identity
Primary color: "Fettle Blue" #2D7FF9

Secondary: Slate #1F2937, Mint #2BD4A7

Metaphor: a hex‑nut (infrastructure) with a checkmark (compliance) embedded — conveys “secured, in good order.”

Logo system:

Icon: hexagon outline with an inner checkmark; small radii, geometric, works at 16px.

Wordmark: "Fettle" in a modern geometric grotesk (e.g., Inter/Plus Jakarta), slightly tightened tracking.

Motion: subtle 120ms checkmark draw‑in on success states.

A production‑ready monochrome SVG is included below (and separately as a downloadable file). Swap colors in CSS.

<!-- Fettle logo, monochrome; fill currentColor; safe at 16px+ -->
<svg width="256" height="256" viewBox="0 0 256 256" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-labelledby="title" role="img">
  <title>Fettle</title>
  <defs>
    <clipPath id="hex">
      <path d="M128 12l93 54v108l-93 54-93-54V66z"/>
    </clipPath>
  </defs>
  <g fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="16" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round">
    <path d="M128 12l93 54v108l-93 54-93-54V66z"/>
    <path d="M88 128l32 32 48-64"/>
  </g>
</svg>
Usage examples:

Icon button: class text-[#2D7FF9] on white; or text-white on slate background.

Success states animate the check path (CSS stroke-dasharray/stroke-dashoffset).

2) Product Vision
A declarative configuration management and desired‑state engine that converges any fleet (VMs, bare metal, containers) to a known state, continuously detects drift, and remediates safely. Fettle synthesizes the best of Chef (resource DSL), Puppet (catalog/graph and idempotence), Ansible (simple inventory/SSH), Salt (event bus), and Terraform (plan/apply diffs) — implemented as a fast, typed, Go‑native platform with modern security and extensibility.

3) High‑Level Architecture
Control Plane (central):

API Gateway (gRPC + JSON/HTTP): authn/authz, multi‑tenant.

Scheduler: builds resource graphs per target set, partitions into batches, drives reconciliation.

Compiler: compiles modules (FSL – Fettle State Language) into a Resource Graph (DAG) with types/constraints.

Planner: computes Plan (create, mutate, replace, delete) via provider Diff() functions.

OPA/CEL Policy Engine: admission and runtime policy gates.

State Store: desired state, prior state, runtime facts, and run histories (PostgreSQL + object storage for artifacts); etcd for leader election/locks.

Event Bus: NATS or Redis Streams for events/telemetry.

Registry: versioned modules/providers as OCI artifacts.

Data Plane (on targets):

Agent (static Go binary):

Channels: mTLS gRPC to control plane; SSH/WinRM fallback for agentless.

Executes resources via providers (built‑in and WASM).

Local cache & facts collector (OS, packages, services, hardware).

Drift monitor (fs/package/service probes) with backoff & jitter.

Provider Model:

Interface: Validate(), Read(), Diff(desired, current), Apply(plan), Rollback(snapshot).

Runtime options: native Go plugin (relinked), WASM via wazero for safety & polyglot.

Transport & Security:

mTLS with SPIFFE identities; short‑lived certs rotated by control plane.

RBAC: org → project → environment → target; resource‑level permissions.

Signed modules/providers (cosign, OCI) + attestations (SLSA provenance).

4) Core Concepts & Data Model
Inventory: dynamic (cloud, CMDB, labels) or static (YAML). Targets grouped by selectors (labels, facts, expressions).

Module: reusable package of resources + variables + outputs + tests + docs; versioned; published to the registry.

Resource: typed unit (e.g., pkg, file, service, user, sysctl, template, archive, shell, systemd.timer).

Graph: DAG with explicit ordering via dependsOn and implicit via providers (e.g., file before service).

Plan: deterministic change‑set with reason codes, safety level, and estimated impact.

Run: execution of a plan with streaming logs and signed results.

Schema (YAML/JSON with JSON Schema + CUE types):

apiVersion: fettle.dev/v1
kind: Module
metadata:
  name: webserver
  version: 1.2.0
spec:
  variables:
    port: {type: int, default: 8080}
  resources:
    - type: pkg
      name: nginx
      ensure: present
    - type: file
      path: /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/app.conf
      mode: "0644"
      owner: root
      group: root
      template:
        from: templates/app.conf.tmpl
        data:
          port: "${var.port}"
      notify:
        - restart: nginx
    - type: service
      name: nginx
      state: running
      enabled: true
5) Execution Model (Convergence Loop)
Facts collected → Compiler resolves module tree and variables.

Build Resource Graph → Planner asks providers for desired vs. current → Plan.

Policy gates (OPA/CEL) evaluate plan; optional approvals for sensitive changes.

Executor runs graph in batches (parallel where safe); provider Apply() commits with per‑resource transaction snapshots.

Drift monitor re‑checks; any drift triggers auto‑remediation or alert‑only per policy.

Safety:

Idempotence required; providers must encode convergence logic.

Transactional boundaries with checkpoint/rollback support when practical.

Reboot orchestration: agent can request a reboot and resume; controller sequences hosts.

6) Providers (Initial Set)
Core OS: pkg (apt, dnf, yum, zypper, apk, brew, choco), file, directory, archive, template (Go text/template + CUE), user, group, service (systemd, upstart, launchd, Windows services), cron/systemd.timer, kernel.param, selinux, firewalld, ufw.

Cloud (read‑only facts + limited write): AWS (SSM, tags), Azure (VM metadata), GCP (metadata), for targeting and inventory enrichment.

Databases: Postgres/MySQL/MariaDB user/schema privileges.

Networking: hosts, resolv, route (limited), interface (idempotent IP/config via Netlink on Linux).

Scripting: shell and powershell (discouraged except for edge cases; wrapped with guardrails and change detection).

Provider packaging:

OCI image with WASM module and manifest.

Version constraints and capabilities advertisement (e.g., supports Windows, requires root).

7) Policy, Compliance, and Guardrails
Policies: Rego (OPA) or CEL expressions attach at org/project/environment/module/resource.

Examples:

Prohibit unmanaged shell in prod.

Require plan approval if touching /etc/ssh/sshd_config.

Enforce CIS baselines as reusable modules with policy tests.

Attestations: Each run produces signed SBOM of providers and modules used.

Audit log: immutable append‑only with per‑field redaction for secrets.

8) Secrets & Credentials
Secret references via providers to KMS/HashiCorp Vault/AWS Secrets Manager/Azure Key Vault/GCP Secret Manager.

No secrets at rest in state store; only references + envelope decryption in agent memory.

Agent executes as least‑privileged; Linux: optional sudoers rules emitted by module; Windows: runAs service account.

9) Packaging, Registry, and Supply Chain
Module format:

/fettle.yaml (manifest)

/resources/*.yaml

/templates/

/tests/ (unit with golden diffs + integration harness)

/docs/README.md

Registry: OCI‑backed; fettle login|push|pull; supports provenance (SLSA), cosign signatures, and yanked versions.

10) CLI & UX

# Init a project\ fettle init

# Pull a module

fettle module add fettle.dev/std/nginx@1.2.0

# Target: all web servers in eu‑west‑1 with label role=web

fettle target select label:role=web region:eu-west-1

# Plan

UI:

Runs view (real‑time status by resource graph).

Drift dashboard with heatmap by environment.

Inventory browser (labels, facts, compliance posture).

Plan viewer with diff summaries and risk scoring.

11) APIs (proto excerpts)
service Agent {
  rpc Register(AgentHello) returns (RegisterAck);
  rpc Stream(AgentStream) returns (stream ControllerMsg);
  rpc Facts(FactsRequest) returns (FactsResponse);
}

}

message Resource {
  string type = 1;
  string name = 2;
  map<string, Value> spec = 3;
  repeated string depends_on = 4;
}
12) Non‑Functional Requirements (NFRs)
Performance:

10k nodes per control plane cluster; 50k resources/minute planned; 10k/minute applied with 100 agents/second concurrent.

Agent memory < 50MB steady; binary < 25MB (linux/amd64).

Reliability: Controller HA with 3+ nodes; zero‑single‑point; idempotent retries; exactly‑once plan ids.

Security: FIPS crypto option; FedRAMP moderate alignment; SCIM for identity.

Portability: Linux (glibc+musl), Windows Server 2016+, macOS 12+; ARM64 and x86_64.

13) Testing Strategy
Provider test kit: contract tests run in Docker/Containerd with golden files.

Module unit tests: template rendering, plan diffs, policy checks.

End‑to‑end: ephemeral VMs (qemu/cloud) + synthetic failures (network partition, low disk).

Canary: sample 1‑5% of fleet, automatic rollback on failure budget breach.

14) Telemetry & Observability
OpenTelemetry traces/spans around planner/executor/provider calls.

Metrics: runs/min, success rate, drift rate,

Want me to scaffold the initial Go repo layout (controller, agent, SDK, CLI) and proto files next?

You said:
i dont like it, come up with an alternative, ideally one that doesn't use agents. or are agents required?
ChatGPT said:
Great question — let’s unpack this carefully before I pitch you an alternative.

✅ Do you need agents?
Not necessarily. It depends on your tradeoffs:

Agent-based (Chef, Puppet, Salt, Fettle I sketched):

Pros:

Continuous drift detection (daemon watches local system).

Rich local APIs (package manager, services, etc.) without extra hops.

Works offline or behind firewalls (agent reconnects later).

Lower per-execution overhead (no need to re-establish SSH each run).

Cons:

Operational overhead (binary distribution, lifecycle mgmt).

Security surface (long-lived agent credentials).

Can feel “heavyweight.”

Agentless (Ansible-style):

Pros:

No persistent footprint on hosts.

Simple to adopt — just SSH/WinRM/Cloud API access.

Centralized execution = easier upgrades.

Cons:

Harder to do real-time drift detection (need periodic scans).

Higher latency per run (reconnect, auth, env bootstrap).

Scale bottlenecks at the controller.

Hybrid is common today (Ansible + AWX for orchestration, Salt has “salt-ssh,” Terraform has remote provisioners).

🔄 Alternative vision (agentless, Go-native)
Name
Chisel — “carving infrastructure into shape” (short, strong, declarative).

Brand/Logo concept
Minimalist chisel + block outline (square with diagonal notch).

Colors: Dark Slate + Amber highlight.

No “continuous agent” motif — logo feels sharp, surgical, stateless.

Core approach
Agentless orchestration via SSH (Linux/macOS), WinRM (Windows), and Cloud APIs.

Controller compiles a desired state graph, then executes tasks remotely using ephemeral connections.

Facts gathering via ad-hoc probes (executed on demand).

Drift detection scheduled (cron-like) or triggered manually/through events.

Execution engine is concurrent SSH multiplexer with robust retry/backoff.

Providers implemented in Go, executed remotely by pushing compiled payloads or one-shot binaries (no daemon stays behind).

Spec differences vs agent-based:
No persistent footprint on targets. Controller drives all execution.

Optional “sidecar” agent (binary drop-in) only if you want continuous drift detection — but not required.

Auditability improved: every action lives in controller logs; no “agent acting alone.”

Scalability: Horizontal controllers with worker pools (each handling hundreds of SSH sessions).

Example CLI UX

# Initialize project

chisel init

# Define module

chisel module add std/nginx@1.0.0

# Run against 500 webservers (SSH key auth)

chisel apply --inventory hosts.yaml --module nginx

# Check drift without applying

chisel drift --inventory hosts.yaml
Internal flow
Compile modules → resource graph.

Connect via SSH/WinRM → run provider commands inline or as temporary binaries.

Collect facts & diffs → plan output.

Apply changes → report logs centrally.

Exit — nothing left resident on the node.

🔑 Key Differentiators
Truly agentless by default (like Ansible, but with a Go-fast execution core).

Typed modules and plan/apply diffs (Terraform-like determinism).

No Python dependency (biggest complaint about Ansible).

Concurrent at scale (Go SSH multiplexer far outperforms Ansible forks).

Optional continuous mode (lightweight “scout” agent if you want drift detection, but not required).

👉 So: agents are not required, unless you need continuous, real-time, autonomous convergence. For many orgs, agentless + scheduled drift checks are enough.

Would you like me to expand this Chisel spec into the same level of detail I did for Fettle (full architecture, logo SVG, provider set, roadmap)?

You said:
chisel is much nicer. what is the long term roadmap that devops people would actually adopt it. what tool/s would it replace and what would it work well alongside?
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — “Chisel” is a really strong direction.
If you want DevOps engineers, SREs, and platform teams to actually adopt it (vs. it being “yet another config tool”), the roadmap must line up with how people evolve their infra stacks today.

🪓 Chisel — Adoption Roadmap

1. Immediate Pain Points (MVP → Year 1)
Target users: Small/medium infra teams frustrated with Ansible sprawl or “Python everywhere.”

Positioning: “Agentless configuration & drift control, but fast and typed.”

Replaces / competes with

Ansible (esp. ad-hoc provisioning, patching, server config).

Fabric, Capistrano, custom SSH scripts.

Early-stage use instead of Chef/Puppet (for those who never wanted an agent).

Coexists with

Terraform (infra provisioning).

Vault/SSM (secrets).

Prometheus/Grafana (monitoring).

MVP features:

SSH/WinRM execution with concurrency pools.

Core providers: pkg, file, service, user, template.

Typed modules + registry (OCI-backed).

Plan/Apply diffs like Terraform (big differentiator from Ansible).

Inventory: static YAML + dynamic (cloud queries).

Drift detection on-demand (manual runs).

2. Scale-Out and Policy (Year 2)
Target users: Mid/large infra teams managing hundreds to thousands of servers.

Positioning: “The fast, stateless config engine with built-in policy and compliance.”

Adds:

Scheduler/controller clustering (HA).

Policy gates (OPA/Rego or CEL).

Compliance modules (CIS, NIST baselines).

UI/dashboard (plans, diffs, drift heatmap).

Drift detection scheduling (no agent, but periodic “scans”).

Replaces / competes with

Chef/Puppet (many orgs keep them just for compliance).

SaltStack (esp. Salt-SSH mode).

Coexists with

Terraform/CloudFormation: still handle infra provisioning.

GitOps tools (ArgoCD, Flux): works in parallel, Chisel handles OS-level state, GitOps handles cluster config.

3. Cloud-Native + Hybrid (Year 3–4)
Target users: Platform/SRE teams running mixed fleets (VMs + Kubernetes).

Positioning: “A single state engine across VMs, bare metal, and containers.”

Adds:

Kubernetes provider → Chisel can converge ConfigMaps, Deployments, RBAC, etc.

Cloud API providers (AWS, Azure, GCP basics) for simple tasks (tags, metadata).

Optional lightweight agent (“scout”) for real-time drift remediation.

Secrets integrations (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).

Extensible provider SDK (WASM modules).

Replaces / competes with

Ansible Tower/AWX, Salt Enterprise, Rudder, CFEngine.

Partial overlap with Terraform in “pet-server” land (people might just prefer Chisel).

Coexists with

Kubernetes GitOps (ArgoCD/Flux).

Terraform for infra baseline (VPCs, clusters, managed DBs).

4. Enterprise / Compliance-First (Year 5+)
Target users: Large regulated orgs (finance, gov, healthcare).

Positioning: “Compliance-driven state engine with supply chain security.”

Adds:

Full supply-chain attestations (cosign/SLSA).

Drift SLOs (measurable convergence guarantees).

Native RBAC, audit trails, SCIM/SAML integration.

SaaS option (“Chisel Cloud”) for smaller teams that don’t want to run the controller.

Enterprise UI with approval workflows.

Replaces / competes with

Puppet Enterprise, Chef Automate, Salt Enterprise, Rudder.

Coexists with

Terraform Enterprise / Spacelift (infra CI/CD).

ServiceNow / Jira for change approvals (integrated with policy gates).

🔑 Strategic Positioning
Short-term: Drop-in Ansible replacement (faster, typed, Go-native, no Python hell).

Mid-term: Competes with Chef/Puppet/Salt for compliance-driven config mgmt.

Long-term: Complements Terraform & GitOps as the “last mile” state engine across VMs, bare metal, and containers.

Why DevOps would adopt it:

Low-friction start (agentless, SSH only, like Ansible).

Immediate wins (typed modules + plan/apply = less scary than Ansible playbooks).

Scales with them (compliance, policy, drift over time).

Doesn’t fight their existing stack (works with Terraform, Vault, GitOps).

👉 Question for you: do you want Chisel to lean more toward being a better Ansible (day-1 replacement, light and fast), or toward being a better Puppet (compliance + drift-first, heavy-duty)?

That will steer whether the roadmap emphasizes agentless simplicity or optional continuous agents earlier.

You said:
any way that we could replace some other tools as well?
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely 👍 — if you design Chisel smartly, you can eat away at more than just Ansible/Puppet/Chef.
The key is identifying overlapping “adjacent tools” that infra/DevOps teams run today, then folding just enough of that functionality into Chisel to make it the obvious consolidation choice.

Here’s a breakdown of what else Chisel could replace (and why teams would actually ditch them):

🪓 Beyond Config: What Chisel Could Replace

1. Ad-hoc Orchestration Tools
Today: Teams use Ansible, Fabric, Capistrano, RunDeck, custom SSH scripts just to run things across fleets.

Replace with: Chisel’s agentless concurrency engine + inventory selectors.

Pitch: “Stop juggling half-broken SSH scripts. Chisel gives you a typed, idempotent replacement.”

2. Patch & Compliance Tools
Today: WSUS, Landscape (Ubuntu), Red Hat Satellite, or homegrown cron jobs.

Replace with: Chisel pkg + compliance modules (CIS, STIG, NIST packs).

Pitch: “Centralized patch management without vendor lock-in, with drift reporting.”

3. Secret Distribution Utilities
Today: Many use Ansible vault, custom shell scripts with AWS SSM, or bake secrets into AMIs.

Replace with: Chisel’s provider integrations (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, SSM, GCP Secrets).

Pitch: “Secrets flow from source to host at apply-time. No static secrets baked in.”

4. Simple Infra Glue
Today: Teams abuse Ansible for cloud API tasks (tagging, adding DNS records, tweaking IAM roles) because Terraform feels heavy.

Replace with: Chisel cloud providers for lightweight API calls (tags, DNS entries, IAM user policies).

Pitch: “Terraform for the big stuff, Chisel for the day-to-day.”

5. Drift Detection/Remediation Tools
Today: Tools like Rudder, Tanium, or expensive security compliance products monitor drift.

Replace with: Chisel’s scheduled drift scans and optional “scout” agent.

Pitch: “Detect and fix drift in one step, without a parallel toolchain.”

6. Job Orchestrators for Infra Ops
Today: Teams wire up Jenkins, GitLab runners, or RunDeck just to schedule patching/config tasks.

Replace with: Chisel CLI + built-in scheduling & policy gates.

Pitch: “Stop abusing CI/CD for infra. Chisel is infra-native.”

7. Template Engines / Config Renderers
Today: Many still rely on Helm (outside K8s), Ansible Jinja2, or custom templating for configs.

Replace with: Chisel’s typed templates (Go template + CUE).

Pitch: “Config templates with validation — no more ‘stringly typed’ YAML mistakes.”

⚡ Strategic Expansion Roadmap
Year 1–2:

Direct Ansible replacement (orchestration, patching).

Replace ad-hoc SSH tooling (Fabric, Capistrano).

Year 2–3:

Replace patch mgmt tools (Landscape, Satellite).

Eat into compliance tools (Rudder, Tanium baseline use).

Year 3–4:

Lightweight overlap with Terraform for infra glue.

Replace RunDeck/job schedulers for infra operations.

Year 5+:

Become the “last-mile universal state manager,” replacing:

Config mgmt (Puppet, Chef, Ansible)

Compliance mgmt (Rudder, Tanium baseline use)

Patch mgmt (Satellite, WSUS)

Ad-hoc orchestration (Fabric, RunDeck)

🤝 What Chisel Should Work Alongside
You don’t want to fight every tool. Position Chisel as complementary to:

Terraform/CloudFormation → still king for infra provisioning.

Vault/SSM/Secrets Manager → Chisel consumes, doesn’t replace.

GitOps tools (ArgoCD, Flux) → for K8s workloads.

Monitoring/alerting (Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog) → Chisel produces telemetry into them.

✨ The “killer pitch” for Chisel becomes:

“One tool instead of five — Chisel replaces Ansible, Puppet, patch management tools, drift detectors, and SSH scripts — while playing nicely with Terraform, Vault, and GitOps.”

Would you like me to sketch a competitive matrix (Chisel vs Ansible, Puppet, Terraform, Rudder, RunDeck, etc.) so you can see exactly what it replaces, coexists with, or outperforms?

🧩 Summary
Direct Replacements:

Ansible (agentless orchestration, config, ad-hoc ops).

Puppet/Chef/Salt (config drift mgmt, compliance).

Patch tools (WSUS, Landscape, Satellite) — for patch baseline + reports.

Rudder/Tanium (lite) — drift + compliance checks.

RunDeck/Jenkins (infra ops jobs) — Chisel becomes the right native place for these tasks.

Coexistence (don’t fight, integrate):

Terraform → infra provisioning (Chisel stays focused on config/drift/patch).

Vault/Secrets Managers → Chisel consumes secrets.

GitOps → for K8s apps (Chisel handles nodes/OS).

Prometheus/Grafana → Chisel exports metrics, doesn’t replace monitoring.

Strategic win: Teams can collapse 3–5 tools into Chisel while still plugging into their existing Terraform + GitOps stack.

That’s cost savings and fewer moving parts.

Would you like me to visualize this matrix as a 2D chart (e.g. “Tool scope vs. footprint” → Chisel sits between Ansible & Terraform, extending into compliance) so you can pitch it in slides?

Here’s a visual of where Chisel could sit compared to existing DevOps tools:

Bottom-left (small scope, small footprint) → RunDeck, WSUS, Satellite (narrow/limited use).

Middle cluster → Puppet, Chef, SaltStack, Ansible (classic config mgmt, heavier footprint).

Top-right → Terraform (huge scope, heavier footprint).

Chisel → positioned as broad in scope, but with a lightweight footprint — giving teams Terraform-like reach with Ansible-like simplicity.

This shows how Chisel can both replace (Puppet/Chef/Salt/Ansible) and complement (Terraform), while also eating into orchestration/rudder/tanium territory.

👉 Do you want me to expand this into a long-term roadmap graphic (like phases: config mgmt → orchestration → infra as code → compliance/security), so you can pitch it to DevOps leads?

Here’s the long-term roadmap for Chisel:

Phase 1: Core Config Management → Lightweight, agentless, push-based configs. Direct replacement for Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Salt.

Phase 2: Orchestration & Workflow → Declarative workflows + multi-host coordination. Encroaches on RunDeck, complements Terraform.

Phase 3: Infra as Code Expansion → Provision + configure in one system. Begins to replace parts of Terraform.

Phase 4: Policy & Compliance → Drift detection, audit trails, remediation. Replaces Rudder, WSUS, Tanium niches.

Phase 5: Cloud-native & Security → Kubernetes-native mode, secrets integration, zero-trust. Works well with Vault, Argo, OPA.

This shows how Chisel can start small (easy config tool) but grow into a Terraform + Puppet + Vault hybrid that DevOps teams would actually adopt.

Want me to also map this against adoption strategy (who uses it first: SREs → platform teams → enterprise infra/security) so you see how to break into the market?
